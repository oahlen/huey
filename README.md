# Huey

Neovim lua color scheme generator written in Rust.

Huey makes it easy to create a minimal lua based neovim colorscheme with
[HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) based color generation.

The project takes inspiration from [colorgen-nvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/colorgen-nvim) and borrows some of the
data format semantics in the theme file but also enhanches it with HSL based functions.

## Build project

The project is written in Rust and therefore built with cargo. To build and install the program locally run the following
commands:

```bash
cargo build
cargo install --path .
```

The project also comes with a nix flake which provides an appropriate development environment and build hook. Experience
with nix and a flake enabled nix installation are of course required for this option.

Enter dev shell:

```bash
nix develop
```

Build the default huey nix package:

```bash
nix build
```

## Basic usage

The program requires a theme file and an optional positional argument for the output directory of the lua files:
The following command generates a theme in the current working directory:

```bash
huey /path/to/my/awesome/theme.toml .
```

## File format

Theme files are written in the [toml](https://toml.io/en/) format and contains the following sections:

* [**hues**] - dictionary of base hues to use in your colorscheme, can be referenced as variables in later sections
* [**colors**] - dictionary of colors to use in your colorscheme, can be created and manipulated with HSL based functions
* [**highlights**] - dictionary of the final nvim highlights, references the colors in the previous sections
* [**globals**] - dictionary of the color variables to be inserted under *vim.g...*, references the colors in the previous sections, i.e. not highlights
  * This section is useful for setting the colors of the integrated Neovim terminal: `terminal_color_0 = "my_terminal_color"`

## Functions

The following functions are available in the `colors` section:

### hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Takes a hue value (0-360), saturation value (0-1.0) and a lightness value (0-1.0) and creates a color variable.
The hue value can use a variable from the `[hues]` section with the `$` symbol.

### adjust(existing-color, saturation, lightness)

Takes an already defined color and adjusts its saturation and lightness values with a delta. Keep in mind that the delta
is not relative but absolute. A color with lightness 0.8 and a delta of -0.4 would result in a new color with lightness
0.4. Resulting saturation and lightness values are clamped between 0 and 1.

### darken(existing-color, value)

Shorthand method for decreasing the lightness component of the color. Behaves as the adjust method without a saturation
delta.

### lighten(existing-color, value)

Shorthand method for increasing the lightness component of the color. Behaves as the adjust method without a saturation
delta.

### mix(color1, color2, weight)

Mixes two existing colors into a new one based ona  weight. The weight is relative to the first color: 1.0 just returns
the first color, 0.5 return a 50/50 mix of the two colors, 0.0 just returns the second color.

### Regular hex color

It is also possible to declare colors with regular hex notation. The colors behave exactly the same as colors declared
with HSL.

## Highlights section

The format is very similar to **colorgen-nvim**:

* `foreground background style special`
* `link:<name of hl group>`

The '-' is used to skip a particular section and replace it with NONE

The style options are the following:

* o: standout
* u: underline
* c: undercurl
* d: underdouble
* t: underdotted
* h: underdashed
* s: strikethrough
* i: italic
* b: bold
* r: reverse
* n: nocombine
